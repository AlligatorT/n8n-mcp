    description: `Automatically detects and fixes common workflow validation errors in n8n workflows. This tool:

- Fetches the workflow from your n8n instance
- Runs comprehensive validation to detect issues
- Generates targeted fixes for common problems
- Optionally applies the fixes back to the workflow

The auto-fixer can resolve:
1. **Expression Format Issues**: Missing '=' prefix in n8n expressions (e.g., {{ $json.field }} → ={{ $json.field }})
2. **TypeVersion Corrections**: Downgrades nodes with unsupported typeVersions to maximum supported
3. **Error Output Configuration**: Removes conflicting onError settings when error connections are missing
4. **Node Type Corrections**: Intelligently fixes unknown node types using similarity matching:
   - Handles deprecated package prefixes (n8n-nodes-base. → nodes-base.)
   - Corrects capitalization mistakes (HttpRequest → httpRequest)
   - Suggests correct packages (nodes-base.openai → nodes-langchain.openAi)
   - Uses multi-factor scoring: name similarity, category match, package match, pattern match
   - Only auto-fixes suggestions with ≥90% confidence
   - Leverages NodeSimilarityService with 5-minute caching for performance
5. **Webhook Path Generation**: Automatically generates UUIDs for webhook nodes missing path configuration:
   - Generates a unique UUID for webhook path
   - Sets both 'path' parameter and 'webhookId' field to the same UUID
   - Ensures webhook nodes become functional with valid endpoints
   - High confidence fix as UUID generation is deterministic
6. **Smart Version Upgrades** (NEW): Proactively upgrades nodes to their latest versions:
   - Detects outdated node versions and recommends upgrades
   - Applies smart migrations with auto-migratable property changes
   - Handles breaking changes intelligently (Execute Workflow v1.0→v1.1, Webhook v2.0→v2.1, etc.)
   - Generates UUIDs for required fields (webhookId), sets sensible defaults
   - HIGH confidence for non-breaking upgrades, MEDIUM for breaking changes with auto-migration
   - Example: Execute Workflow v1.0→v1.1 adds inputFieldMapping automatically
7. **Version Migration Guidance** (NEW): Documents complex migrations requiring manual intervention:
   - Identifies breaking changes that cannot be auto-migrated
   - Provides AI-friendly post-update guidance with step-by-step instructions
   - Lists required actions by priority (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
   - Documents behavior changes and their impact
   - Estimates time required for manual migration steps
   - MEDIUM/LOW confidence - requires review before applying

The tool uses a confidence-based system to ensure safe fixes:
- **High (≥90%)**: Safe to auto-apply (exact matches, known patterns)
- **Medium (70-89%)**: Generally safe but review recommended
- **Low (<70%)**: Manual review strongly recommended
