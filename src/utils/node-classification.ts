/**
 * Node Classification Utilities
 *
 * Provides shared classification logic for workflow nodes.
 * Used by validators to consistently identify node types across the codebase.
 *
 * This module centralizes node type classification to ensure consistent behavior
 * between WorkflowValidator and n8n-validation.ts, preventing bugs like sticky
 * notes being incorrectly flagged as disconnected nodes.

 * Check if a node type is a sticky note (documentation-only node)
 *
 * Sticky notes are UI-only annotation nodes that:
 * - Do not participate in workflow execution
 * - Never have connections (by design)
 * - Should be excluded from connection validation
 * - Serve purely as visual documentation in the workflow canvas
 *
 * Example sticky note types:
 * - 'n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote' (standard format)
 * - 'nodes-base.stickyNote' (normalized format)
 * - '@n8n/n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote' (scoped format)
 *
 * @param nodeType - The node type to check (e.g., 'n8n-nodes-base.stickyNote')
 * @returns true if the node is a sticky note, false otherwise

 * - Start workflow execution

 *
 * Examples:
 * - Webhooks: Listen for HTTP requests
