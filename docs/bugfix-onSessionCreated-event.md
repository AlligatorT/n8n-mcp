# Bug Fix: onSessionCreated Event Not Firing (v2.19.0)

## Summary

Fixed critical bug where `onSessionCreated` lifecycle event was never emitted for sessions created during the standard MCP initialize flow, completely breaking session persistence functionality.

## Impact

- **Severity**: Critical
- **Affected Version**: v2.19.0
- **Component**: Session Persistence (Phase 3)
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

## Root Cause

The `handleRequest()` method in `http-server-single-session.ts` had two different paths for session creation:

1. **Standard initialize flow** (lines 868-943): Created session inline but **did not emit** `onSessionCreated` event
2. **Manual restoration flow** (line 1048): Called `createSession()` which **correctly emitted** the event

This inconsistency meant that:
- New sessions during normal operation were **never saved to database**
- Only manually restored sessions triggered the save event
- Session persistence was completely broken for new sessions
- Container restarts caused all sessions to be lost

## The Fix

### Location
- **File**: `src/http-server-single-session.ts`
- **Method**: `handleRequest()`
- **Line**: After line 943 (`await server.connect(transport);`)

### Code Change

Added event emission after successfully connecting server to transport during initialize flow:

```typescript
// Connect the server to the transport BEFORE handling the request
logger.info('handleRequest: Connecting server to new transport');
await server.connect(transport);

// Phase 3: Emit onSessionCreated event (REQ-4)
// Fire-and-forget: don't await or block session creation
this.emitEvent('onSessionCreated', sessionIdToUse, instanceContext).catch(eventErr => {
  logger.error('Failed to emit onSessionCreated event (non-blocking)', {
    sessionId: sessionIdToUse,
    error: eventErr instanceof Error ? eventErr.message : String(eventErr)
  });
});
```

### Why This Works

1. **Consistent with existing pattern**: Matches the `createSession()` method pattern (line 664)
2. **Non-blocking**: Uses `.catch()` to ensure event handler errors don't break session creation
3. **Correct timing**: Fires after `server.connect(transport)` succeeds, ensuring session is fully initialized
4. **Same parameters**: Passes `sessionId` and `instanceContext` just like the restoration flow

## Verification

### Test Results

Created comprehensive test suite to verify the fix:

**Test File**: `tests/unit/session/onSessionCreated-event.test.ts`

**Test Results**:
```
✓ onSessionCreated Event - Initialize Flow
  ✓ should emit onSessionCreated event when session is created during initialize flow (1594ms)

Test Files  5 passed (5)
Tests      78 passed (78)
```

**Manual Testing**:
```typescript
const server = new SingleSessionHTTPServer({
  sessionEvents: {
    onSessionCreated: async (sessionId, context) => {
      console.log('✅ Event fired:', sessionId);
      await saveSessionToDatabase(sessionId, context);
    }
  }
});

// Result: Event fires successfully on initialize!
// ✅ Event fired: 40dcc123-46bd-4994-945e-f2dbe60e54c2
```

### Behavior After Fix

1. **Initialize request** → Session created → `onSessionCreated` event fired → Session saved to database ✅
2. **Session restoration** → `createSession()` called → `onSessionCreated` event fired → Session saved to database ✅
3. **Manual restoration** → `manuallyRestoreSession()` → Session created → Event fired ✅

All three paths now correctly emit the event!

## Backward Compatibility

✅ **Fully backward compatible**:
- No breaking changes to API
- Event handler is optional (defaults to no-op)
- Non-blocking implementation ensures session creation succeeds even if handler fails
- Matches existing behavior of `createSession()` method
- All existing tests pass

## Related Code

### Event Emission Points

1. ✅ **Standard initialize flow**: `handleRequest()` at line ~947 (NEW - fixed)
2. ✅ **Manual restoration**: `createSession()` at line 664 (EXISTING - working)
3. ✅ **Session restoration**: calls `createSession()` indirectly (EXISTING - working)

### Other Lifecycle Events

The following events are working correctly:
- `onSessionRestored`: Fires when session is restored from database
- `onSessionAccessed`: Fires on every request (with throttling recommended)
- `onSessionExpired`: Fires before expired session cleanup
- `onSessionDeleted`: Fires on manual session deletion

## Testing Recommendations

After applying this fix, verify session persistence works:

```typescript
// 1. Start server with session events
const engine = new N8NMCPEngine({
  sessionEvents: {
    onSessionCreated: async (sessionId, context) => {
      await database.upsertSession({ sessionId, ...context });
    }
  }
});

// 2. Client connects and initializes
// 3. Verify session saved to database
const sessions = await database.query('SELECT * FROM mcp_sessions');
expect(sessions.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);

// 4. Restart server
await engine.shutdown();
await engine.start();

// 5. Client reconnects with old session ID
// 6. Verify session restored from database
```

## Impact on n8n-mcp-backend

This fix **unblocks** the multi-tenant n8n-mcp-backend service that depends on session persistence:

- ✅ Sessions now persist across container restarts
- ✅ Users no longer need to restart Claude Desktop after backend updates
- ✅ Session continuity maintained for all users
- ✅ Production deployment viable

## Lessons Learned

1. **Consistency is critical**: Session creation should follow the same pattern everywhere
2. **Event-driven architecture**: Events must fire at all creation points, not just some
3. **Testing lifecycle events**: Need integration tests that verify events fire, not just that code runs
4. **Documentation**: Clearly document when events should fire and where

## Files Changed

- `src/http-server-single-session.ts`: Added event emission (lines 945-952)
- `tests/unit/session/onSessionCreated-event.test.ts`: New test file
- `tests/integration/session/test-onSessionCreated-event.ts`: Manual verification test

## Build Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: Success
- ✅ Type checking: Success
- ✅ All unit tests: 78 passed
- ✅ Integration tests: Pass
- ✅ Backward compatibility: Verified
